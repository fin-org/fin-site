## Intuitive Syntax

Data interchange between programs doesnâ€™t require comments, commas, newlines or indentation to
correctly convey values. However, fin is designed for us too, so it does have _human_ syntax
elements.

In fin these elements directly control the formatted output in an obvious, canonical way. The idea
(inspired by `zig fmt`) is showcased in the example.

Fin encoders output formatted text with **zero** configuration. No external formatters are required.
