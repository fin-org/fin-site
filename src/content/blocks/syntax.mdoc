## Intuitive Syntax

Data interchange between programs doesnâ€™t require comments, commas, newlines or indentation to
correctly convey values. However, fin is designed for us too, so it does have syntax elements for
humans.

In fin these elements directly control the (auto-formatted) output in an obvious, canonical way.
Machines generate mostly inline data, while human authored notation will expand as required with
zero configuration.
