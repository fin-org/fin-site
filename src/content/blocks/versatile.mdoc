## Versatile

core value types

- high leverage - powerful
- symbols and tagged collections are natural fit for representing code DSLs
- they also enable / play into extensibility (key ingredient)
- stick to value semantics! list stuff that's out of scope
- minimal overloading
- quick to internalise
