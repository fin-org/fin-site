## Versatile Data Model

- Fin has simple, self-describing, value semantics (like JSON). It is not concerned with higher
  level concepts such as schemas, validation or remote procedure calls. There is no concept of
  objects or references.
- The data model is a small set of core value types (symbols, strings, numbers, arrays and maps)
  which are combined to form a top level value.
- Symbols and tagged collections make a big difference when producing data with names and
  identifiers (e.g. programs and DSLs).
